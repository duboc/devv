# Product Context

## 1. Problem Solved

This application solves the challenge of translating high-level business needs into actionable technical requirements. It bridges the gap between a user's conceptual goal (a "theme") and the specific artifacts needed for development, such as user stories, development tasks, and database schemas.

## 2. How It Works

The application guides a non-technical or semi-technical user through a structured, four-step workflow:

1.  **Generate Story:** Transforms a simple theme into a detailed, well-formatted user story.
2.  **Generate Tasks:** Breaks down the user story into granular, sprint-sized development tasks.
3.  **Create DW:** Designs a data warehouse (DW) schema capable of supporting the user story's data requirements.
4.  **Create BigQuery Implementation:** Generates the specific SQL and command-line code needed to implement the DW schema in Google BigQuery.

By automating this process, the application saves time, reduces ambiguity, and ensures consistency between business requirements and technical implementation.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity:** The user interface should be intuitive and require minimal technical knowledge.
- **Guidance:** The step-by-step process should feel guided and logical, preventing the user from getting lost.
- **Clarity:** The output at each stage should be clearly presented and easy to understand.
