# Active Context

## 1. Current Focus

Successfully completed the "User Story to Code" application integration. The navigation issue has been resolved and comprehensive documentation has been added to the memory bank for future application development.

## 2. Recent Decisions & Changes

-   **Application Structure:** The "User Story to Code" application follows the established modular pattern with Flask blueprints
-   **Navigation Fix:** Corrected data-page attribute mismatch between navigation menu and JavaScript routing
-   **Documentation Enhancement:** Added comprehensive patterns and debugging guide to systemPatterns.md
-   **Code Re-use:** Application leverages existing `utils/utils_vertex.py` for AI capabilities

## 3. Current Status

"User Story to Code" application is fully functional:
- ✅ Blueprint registration in `app.py`
- ✅ Route definitions in `apps/story_to_code/routes.py`
- ✅ Template file in `apps/story_to_code/templates/story_to_code.html`
- ✅ JavaScript navigation properly configured
- ✅ Navigation menu integration working correctly
- ✅ Dynamic content loading within sidebar navigation

## 4. Key Learning Documented

**Root Cause Identified**: Navigation `data-page` attribute must exactly match JavaScript pageData keys
**Solution Applied**: Changed `data-page="user-story-to-code"` to `data-page="story_to_code"`

## 5. Next Steps

The modular architecture is now ready for additional applications. Future developers can reference the comprehensive guide in systemPatterns.md for:
- Navigation integration requirements
- Common debugging issues and solutions
- Naming conventions for consistency
- Blueprint setup patterns
