# Project Progress

## 1. What Works

-   **Full Application Migration:** The Streamlit application has been successfully migrated to a Flask application.
-   **Modern UI:** The application features a completely redesigned user interface with a sidebar for navigation, a tabbed layout for the demo, and improved styling.
-   **Core Functionality:** All original features (generating stories, tasks, DW schemas, and BigQuery implementations) are fully functional.
-   **Configuration:** The application correctly loads configuration from a `.env` file.
-   **Markdown Rendering:** The frontend now correctly renders markdown in the results.

## 2. What's Left to Build

-   **Modular Architecture:** The application needs to be refactored into a more modular structure to support multiple, independent applications.
-   **Blueprint Implementation:** Use Flask Blueprints to organize routes for each new application.
-   **Dynamic App Loading:** Implement a system to dynamically load and render different applications based on the sidebar navigation.

## 3. Current Status

-   **Phase:** Modular Architecture Implementation Complete
-   **Progress:** 75% complete. Two applications are fully functional (User Story to Data and User Story to Code), with proper modular structure implemented.

## 4. Recent Achievements

-   **User Story to Code Application:** Successfully implemented and integrated
-   **Modular Blueprint Architecture:** All applications now use Flask blueprints properly
-   **Navigation System:** Fixed data-page attribute mismatch that was causing routing issues
-   **Template Resolution:** Confirmed proper template loading for blueprint-based applications

## 5. Known Issues

-   Additional applications in the navigation menu are placeholders and not yet implemented
-   Some model environment variables may need adjustment for optimal performance
