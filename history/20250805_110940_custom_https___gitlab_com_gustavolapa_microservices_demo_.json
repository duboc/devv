{"type": "custom", "text": "No, the provided Kubernetes manifests in `kubernetes-manifests` and `release` directories do not include Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configurations.  The deployment YAMLs define resource requests and limits for CPU and memory, but there's no HPA resource defined to automatically scale the number of pods based on metrics like CPU utilization.\n\nTo configure HPA, you would need to add a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` resource to your Kubernetes manifests. Here's an example of how you might configure an HPA for the `frontend` service:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: autoscaling/v2\nkind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\nmetadata:\n  name: frontend-hpa\nspec:\n  scaleTargetRef:\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\n    kind: Deployment\n    name: frontend\n  minReplicas: 1\n  maxReplicas: 10\n  metrics:\n  - type: Resource\n    resource:\n      name: cpu\n      target:\n        type: Utilization\n        averageUtilization: 50\n```\n\nThis HPA targets the `frontend` deployment and will scale the number of replicas between 1 and 10, aiming for an average CPU utilization of 50%. You can adapt this example for other services by changing the `name` in `scaleTargetRef` and adjusting the metrics and scaling limits as needed.  You would then apply this HPA configuration along with your other Kubernetes manifests.\n", "repo_url": "https://gitlab.com/gustavolapa/microservices-demo-ref", "timestamp": "20250805_110940"}
